    price: "The relationship between days away from work and number of injuries in each state is shown by a line chart. By observations and calculations with R, they are positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.274245. Contrary to common belief, the more regularly workers are being away from work, the more they are exposed to injury. This is because occupational self-protection needs practice to become habitual for better safety purposes.",

    price: "The relationship between prolonged schedules and number of injuries in each state is shown by a line chart. By observations and calculations with R, they are positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.02135259. Within certain states that maintain more long work schedules than others, their number of injuries also increases. It is recommended, through the data set, that companies should practice time-management and efficiency in their scheduling system, which can have certain impact on worker’s occupational safety.",

Occupational injuries have gone from nearly 1 million cases in 2002 to only 268,000 cases in 2011. The improvement is thanks to better occupational safety education and investment provided to workers by companies. However, it is still a worker’s responsibility to main personal protection against different odds during work. ",
